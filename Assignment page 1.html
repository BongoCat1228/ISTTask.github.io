		<h2>Explain how the web works, the role of web servers, what are web browsers?</h2>
		<p>The world wide web is a system of linked hypertext documents of various kinds that are accesible though the internet. It aloows users to upload, retrieve and display texts and media on the vast system. It allows people to join and contribute making it an interconnected web.
		The role of a web server is to display content via storing, delivering and processing data continuously to users as long as its host is online. In other words the servers allow us to access all the documments listed within its own web as long as the device running it isn't turned off.
		Web browsers are are application softwares that retrieve and collect information from the world wide web for the user. For example google chrome is a widely used web browser that shows us the information or media we search for on our devices by collecting a copy of it from the web and displaying it on our device's screen.

		<h2>How is the world wide web different to the internet?</h2>
		<p>The internet is the system of interconnected devices linked via various networks while the world wide web is an interconnected system of visual and written documents. In order to access the world wide web we have to connect or use the internet to access it since we need anetwork to reach it.</p>

		<h2> What is an intranet? How does it relate to the internet?</h2>
		<p>An intranet is a network that funtions in a similar way to the internet and the world wide web but it has limit or restricted access to certain authorized or approved people such as classfied information held by a government organization or just a typical company with employees that can only access through that particular network. It is related to the internet since they are both a network that can access the world wide web.</p>
		
		<h2>What is an internet protocol? compare HTTP, TCP/IP and FTP</h2>
		<p>An internet protocol is the method and proccess by which data or documents are transferred from one computer to another. For example, HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) allows users to access html documents by transmitting hypertext messages between their client and the server they are using. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a software that establishes and maintains network conversations via application programs that can or exchange data. IP (Internet Protocol) is a software that shows how computers send packets of data to one another, similar to TCP but different in size and data. Finally FTP (File Tranfer Protocol) is very similar or almost the same as all the others but transfers files containing data.</p>
